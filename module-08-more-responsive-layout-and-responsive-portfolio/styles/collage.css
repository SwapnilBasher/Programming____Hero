/* 
    Great question 👍 This is a **very common confusion** in CSS.

## ✅ `width: 100%`

* Means: **100% of the parent element’s width**
* Depends on the container
* Respects padding of parent (usually behaves nicely inside layouts)

### Example:

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
}
```

If the parent div is **800px**, the image becomes **800px**.

If the parent div is **50% of screen**, image follows that.

👉 It is *relative to the parent*.

---

## ✅ `width: 100vw`

* Means: **100% of the viewport width**
* Ignores parent width
* Can cause horizontal scroll issues

### Example:

```css
img {
  width: 100vw;
}
```

If your screen width is **1920px**, image becomes **1920px**,
even if the parent is smaller.

👉 It is *relative to the browser window*.

---

## ⚠️ Important Difference (Scrollbar Problem)

`100vw` includes the vertical scrollbar width.

So sometimes:

```css
width: 100vw;
```

➡ Creates **horizontal scrolling**
➡ Causes layout overflow

But:

```css
width: 100%;
```

➡ Does NOT usually cause that issue.

---

## 📊 Visual Explanation

### `width: 100%` (Follows Parent)

```
|---------------- Screen ----------------|

   |------ Parent Div ------|
   |  Image = 100% (same)   |
```

---

### `width: 100vw` (Follows Screen)

```
|---------------- Screen ----------------|
| Image = Full Screen Width (ignores parent) |
```

---

## 🧠 When To Use What?

| Use Case                       | Recommended |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Normal website layout          | ✅ `100%`    |
| Full-screen hero section       | ✅ `100vw`   |
| Inside container/grid          | ✅ `100%`    |
| Background banner edge-to-edge | ✅ `100vw`   |

---

## 💡 Pro Tip

For responsive images inside containers, almost always use:

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

This keeps aspect ratio correct.

If you want, I can show a small HTML demo to test both visually 👀

/* 
This is another **very important CSS concept** 👌
For images, `height: 100%` and `height: auto` behave very differently.

---

# ✅ `height: auto` (Recommended in most cases)

* Keeps the **original aspect ratio**
* Scales proportionally with width
* Prevents image distortion

### Example:

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

👉 What happens?

* Image fills the width
* Height adjusts automatically
* No stretching

📌 This is the **standard responsive image pattern**

---

# ⚠️ `height: 100%`

* Makes the image take **100% of the parent’s height**
* Can **distort** the image
* Only works properly if parent has a fixed height

### Example:

```css
.parent {
  height: 300px;
}

img {
  height: 100%;
}
```

👉 The image becomes exactly 300px tall
👉 Width adjusts based on aspect ratio
👉 May overflow or stretch

---

# 🔍 Visual Difference

## 🟢 `height: auto` (Keeps Ratio)

```
Original: 800x400 (2:1)

width: 400px
height: auto → becomes 200px
```

✔ Perfect proportion

---

## 🔴 `height: 100%` (Can Break Ratio)

If parent height = 300px

```
Image forced to 300px height
Width may not match proportion
```

❌ Can stretch or squish

---

# 🚨 Important Rule

If you write:

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

You are forcing:

* Full width
* Full height

➡ This **almost always distorts the image**
Unless the parent has the exact same aspect ratio.

# 🧠 When To Use What?

| Situation                | Use                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Responsive website       | ✅ `height: auto`        |
| Inside fixed-height card | ⚠️ Maybe `height: 100%` |
| Background-like image    | Better use `object-fit` |

---

# ⭐ Bonus: Best Way for Fixed Containers

If you want image to fill a box without distortion:

```css
.parent {
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
}

img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

✔ Fills box
✔ Keeps ratio
✔ Crops nicely

---

# 🎯 Simple Rule for You

If you're building normal responsive layouts (which you are learning):

👉 **Use `height: auto` 90% of the time**

---

If you want, I can show a live HTML example comparing all 3 (`auto`, `100%`, and `object-fit`) side by side 👀
