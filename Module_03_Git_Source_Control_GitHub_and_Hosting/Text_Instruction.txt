1) What is Git? What are the advantages of using Git?

Answer: Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that records changes to files and coordinates work among multiple people. Advantages include:
- Distributed (every clone has full history, works offline)
- Fast operations (commits, diffs, merges)
- Cheap branching & merging for parallel development
- Integrity (commits are cryptographically linked)
- Staging area for fine-grained commits

2) What do you understand by the term 'Version Control System'?

Answer: A Version Control System (VCS) records and manages changes to files over time so you can review, revert, or branch from previous states. Benefits include history, collaboration, safe experimentation, and auditing.

3) What’s the difference between Git and GitHub?

Answer: Git is the tool (a distributed VCS) that manages commits and history. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories that adds collaboration features like pull requests, issues, and CI/CD. Git can be used without GitHub; GitHub uses Git under the hood.

4) Name a few Git commands with their function.

Answer: Examples of commonly used Git commands:
- git init — create a new repository
- git clone <url> — copy a remote repository locally
- git add <file> — stage changes for commit
- git commit -m "msg" — record staged snapshot
- git status — show working tree status
- git log — view commit history
- git branch — list/create branches
- git switch <branch> / git checkout <branch> — switch branches
- git merge <branch> — merge another branch into current
- git fetch — download remote changes (no merge)
- git pull — fetch + merge (or rebase)
- git push — send commits to remote

5) Difference between git fetch and git pull

Answer: git fetch downloads remote refs and objects to your local repository but does not change your current branch or working files. git pull performs a fetch followed by a merge (or rebase) into your current branch, updating it immediately. Use git fetch to inspect changes before integrating them, and git pull when you want to update in one step.

git fetch
👉 Downloads updates from the remote repository but does not change your code.
Your files stay exactly the same.
You use it when you want to check what changed first.

git pull
👉 Downloads updates and applies them immediately to your current branch.
Your files get updated right away.
You use it when you’re ready to update your code in one step.

Easy way to remember

Fetch = look only 👀

Pull = download + update 🔄
